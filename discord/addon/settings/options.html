    <legend>Options</legend>
    <p class="desc">
    <label class="checkbox"><input id="enableNSFW" type="checkbox"> Enable NSFW emotes</label>
    Several emotes in BetterPonymotes are strongly NSFW in nature, going as
    far as to be explicitly pornographic. This option does not cover every
    emote that you might consider questionable- with a handful of difficult
    exceptions, the emotes it blocks all contain actual genitalia.</p>

    <p class="desc">
    <label class="checkbox"><input id="enableExtraCSS" type="checkbox"> Enable extra emote modifiers</label>
    BetterPonymotes includes a copy of the Chaos script, a collection of
    flags and modifiers on emotes. These do things like make emotes spin
    in multiple dimensions. These can be problematic on some computers.</p>

    <p class="desc">
    <label class="checkbox"><input id="showUnknownEmotes" type="checkbox"> Show placeholders for unknown emotes (may conflict with other emote scripts)</label>
    When BetterPonymotes encounters a link that appears to be an emote, but
    it doesn't know about it, it generates a small placeholder to show you.
    This can conflict if you have other emote scripts that are converting
    the emotes, as BPM doesn't know about these. Turn this off if you are
    having conflict problems.</p>

    <p class="desc">
    <label class="checkbox"><input id="hideDisabledEmotes" type="checkbox"> Hide disabled emotes completely (no placeholders)</label>
    When BPM encounters an emote you have disabled through any means, it
    generates a small placeholder. This option turns them off, trying to
    make them seem to be nonexistent.</p>
    
    <p class="desc">
    <label class="checkbox"><input id="searchButtonTopRight" type="checkbox"> Put search button on top right (Requires Discord restart)</label>
    Some users prefer to see the search button in the top right to
    prevent it from interfering with long lists of servers they're on.
    Enable this setting to make that happen.  Requires restarting Discord
    to see take effect.
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
        <label class="checkbox"><input id="disableDisruptiveEmotes" type="checkbox"> Disable disruptive emotes</label>
        Sometimes other users like to put emotes in annoying places like 
        usernames, game titles, and channel titles.  Enable this option to 
        prevent emotes from rendering there.
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
        <label class="checkbox"><input id="disableEmotesInCodeBlocks" type="checkbox"> Disable emotes in code blocks</label>
        Some users report wierd issues with scrolling when BPM renders
        emotes inside code blocks (```-wrapped text).  Enable this option
        to prevent BPM from rendering them there.
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
    <label class="checkbox"><input id="showAltText" type="checkbox"> Reveal hidden alt-text</label>
    This option controls the alt-text expander, which displays alt-text on
    emotes next to the image. When BPM does this, it also replaces the
    actual alt-text with emote information, including its name and where it
    comes from.</p>

    <p class="desc">
    <label class="checkbox"><input id="clickToggleSFW" type="checkbox"> When I click a disabled emote, only show SFW emotes</label>
    When BPM disables an emote and leaves a placeholder, you can click on
    it to expand it in order to see what it is. Ordinarily, BPM will refuse
    to do this for NSFW emotes. This option disables that check.</p>

    <p class="desc">
    <label>Search result limit: <input id="searchLimit" type="text"> (high values can slow down search)</label>
    BPM has over 8000 emotes, and some search queries return massive amounts of
    them, which can freeze your browser. This option imposes a maximum on the
    number of results you can get. A few hundred is safe and recommended.</p>

    <p class="desc">
    <!--
      Would be nice to use Bootstrap's input-append/add-on "px", but this
      screws up alignment somehow.
    -->
    <label>Maximum emote size: <input id="maxEmoteSize" type="text"> (zero is no limit)</label>
    Emotes larger than this size will be disabled. This can help if you
    find some of the more massive emotes in BPM annoying.</p>
